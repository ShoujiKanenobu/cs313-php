         <p>
            This is my homepage for CS313. My name is Kyle, but my friends call me Shouji, which is my name in japanese. The name was given to me by my grandfather, whose name was Shouichi. Shouichi is written "Masashi the first" and Shouji is written "Masashi the second". I hold this name dearly to my heart because I was never able to meet my grandfather because he passed away before I was born.
